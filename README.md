# Minify JS To Clipboard

A simple Sublime plugin to minify the current selection of JavaScript and copy it to the clipboard. this is useful for when you want to quickly copy and paste large or small amounts of code into the console.


Requires uglifyjs to be installed globally.

	npm install uglifyjs -g

# To use

right click on a selection and then click "Minify selection to clipboard"

Or there's also a hot-key binding that defaults to cmd+shift+c (or ctrl+shift+c on linux/window) for OS X.

After that, just paste!
